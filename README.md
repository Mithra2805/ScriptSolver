ScriptSolver: Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)
ScriptSolver is an advanced machine learning project that recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is designed to identify digits (0-9) from images of handwritten numbers with high accuracy. This project leverages deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to train and evaluate the recognition process.

Overview
ScriptSolver utilizes the MNIST dataset, a large database of handwritten digits, to train a deep learning model. The main objective of this project is to build an efficient model capable of recognizing digits from images and classifying them correctly. This solution can be applied to real-world applications such as digit recognition in scanned forms or check processing.

Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ScriptSolver.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ScriptSolver
Install the necessary Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies
The following dependencies are required for the project:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Pandas
OpenCV
For installation, you can use requirements.txt to install all the dependencies at once.

Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). These images are 28x28 grayscale pixels. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. You can download the dataset directly using TensorFlow or Keras.

Model Architecture
The ScriptSolver model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for image recognition tasks. The architecture of the model is as follows:

Input Layer: Accepts 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
Convolutional Layers: Multiple layers to extract features from the images.
Max-Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality while retaining important features.
Fully Connected Layers: Classify the extracted features into one of 10 digit classes.
Output Layer: Softmax activation function that outputs probabilities for each class.
Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict handwritten digits. The process is simple:

Load a sample image: Provide a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit.
Preprocess the image: Resize and normalize the image.
Predict the digit: Use the trained model to predict the class of the digit.
Example:
python
Copy code
from script_solver import predict_digit
result = predict_digit('path_to_image.jpg')
print(f'The predicted digit is: {result}')
Training the Model
To train the model, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This script loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses it, and trains the CNN model on the training data. The model's performance is evaluated using the test set.

Hyperparameters:
Epochs: 10
Batch size: 64
Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: SparseCategoricalCrossentropy
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the MNIST test set after training for X epochs. The training and test accuracy graphs can be found in the results/ folder.
